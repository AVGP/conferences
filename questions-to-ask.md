# Questions to ask

## Why you should ask questions

You've probably just been invited to a conference and are super excited! Congratulations!
However, you may want the conference to answer a few questions. 

Some conferences may provide answers in their confirmation emails, their call for papers or their website - but often you may not find all answers you want.
In that case you should not hesitate to ask your questions! Conference organisers are usually supportive and helpful - and if they're not... do you really want to be part of that?

Also, be aware that speaking at a conference is a two-way relationship:

1. The conference **amplifies your voice & opinion** by giving your voice an audience and a stage.
2. You **vouch for the conference** by joining them, giving them content and signaling that you trust them.

The second part is why you want to ask your questions: People who trust you may attend because of you. 
Your name becomes part of the conference's sales pitch, you vouch for their event.

## What questions to ask?

Those are questions we like to ask upfront to clarify a few standpoints. Feel free to send a pull request to suggest more!

* How many attendees do you plan for?
* How many tracks do you intend to have?* Who else are you trying to get as speakers?
* Are you going to have a Code of Conduct and will you enforce it (note: that includes enforcing it towards sponsors, attendees, organisers and speakers)?
* (useful for languages in (natural) language communities you're not fluent in): What portion of talks will be in English? Is translation *to* English available?
